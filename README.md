# Small Campaign Data Toolkit
## Purpose
I found when I started working on campaign data that so much information was gatekept or not even published. I believe answers should be available in search engines! Here are some useful tools for creating campaign data.
## VAN Turfbook
_Launched April 2021_
Use this example CSV to make a turfbook that you can submit to your VAN vendor in order to get turfs built out. Built from examples provided by past campaign data workers. 
## Whatsapp textbank
_Launched May 2021_
Go to the link and 'create a copy' of the page. Paste in a list exported from VAN, add some text with the proper substitute phrases (see example) and launch a whatsapp textbank! Note that in order to systematically test if a number has whatsapp you'll need to pay for Whatsapp business. 

### It's a modest start but I can't wait to share more useful tools here!
