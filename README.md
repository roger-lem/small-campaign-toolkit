# Small Campaign Data Toolkit
## Purpose
I found when I started working on campaign data that so much information was gatekept or not even published. I believe answers should be discoverable in search engines! Here are some useful tools for campaign data teams.
## Tools
### VAN Turfbook
_Launched April 2021_  
Use this example CSV to make a turfbook that you can submit to your VAN vendor in order to get turfs built out. Built from examples provided by past campaign data workers. 
| state_code  | county | VANPrecinctID  | Region | Organizer  | Team |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| XX  | Xxxx  | xxxxxxxx  | ##  | ##X  | ##X  |
| two-letter state appreviation  | Full name  | Precinct ID as stored in VAN  | number  | same region number, plus a letter to sub-designate  | optional further designation |

### Whatsapp textbank
_Launched May 2021_  
Go to the link and 'create a copy' of the page. Paste in a list exported from VAN, add some text with the proper substitute phrases (see example) and launch a whatsapp textbank! Note that in order to systematically test if a number has whatsapp you'll need to pay for Whatsapp business.

#### It's just the beginning! I can't wait to share more useful tools here.
